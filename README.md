# Automated-Spectral-Fitting
Automated Spectral Fitting - PyXspec based
xspectations performs automated fitting (using pyXspec) of a selection of spectra based on global settings in the txt config file and spectra specific settings in a csv file. 
This is a work in progress. The goal is to have an X-ray fitting package that is controllable entirely from the initial command line call, with the txt and csv, for any fitting scheme.
it has not reached this point, though, and still has some sections that are WIP or hardcoded for my 2022 CGM paper.
